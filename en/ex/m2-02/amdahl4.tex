In your organization, there is an application with the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item The application spends 80\% of time executing instructions and 20\% of the remaining time
waiting for disk operations.

\item The time that the application spends executing instructions is distributed
in 20\% for floating point instruction (which require 8 CPI)
and 80\% for the rest of instructions (which require 6 CPI).

\end{itemize}

You are evaluating the migration to a new machine in which instructions
require 25\% more of CPI but whose clock frequency is double.

What is the global speedup for the application?


\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

\[ 
T_{inst}(orig) = 
0.2 \cdot 8 \cdot IC \cdot T+ 0.8 \cdot 6 \cdot IC \cdot T = 
(1.6 + 4.8) \cdot IC \cdot T = 
6.4 \cdot IC \cdot T 
\]

\[ 
T_{inst}(new) = 
0.2 \cdot 10 \cdot IC \cdot \frac{T}{2} + 0.8 \cdot 7.5 IC \cdot \frac{T}{2} = 
(1 + 3) \cdot IC \cdot T = 
4 \cdot IC \cdot T 
\]

\[ 
S_{inst} = 
\frac{6.4}{4} = 
1.6 
\]

\[ 
S = 
\frac{1}{0.2 + \frac{0.8}{1.6}} = 
\frac{1}{0.2 + 0.5} = 
\frac{1}{0.7} =1,42
