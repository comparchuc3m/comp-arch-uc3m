A processor as FIT (\emph{failures in time}) of 200. Replacing the processor requires 3 days.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the MTTF (\emph{mean time to failure})?

\item What is the system's availability?

\item What is the MTTF of a data center using 100 of those processors? And if we use 1000?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The FIT is expressed in failures per $10^9$ hours. Consequently:

\[MTTF = 10^9 \frac{1}{FIT} = \frac{10^9}{2 \cdot 10^2} = 0.5 \cdot 10^7 hours\]

\item The time to repair is $3 \cdot 24 = 72$ hours. Consequently:

\[
A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTR} =
\frac{0.5 \cdot 10^7}{0.5 \cdot 10^7 + 72} =
0.9999856 \approx 1
\]

\item If we assume that a failure in any processor makes the system to fail.

\[
A = \prod_{i=1}^{100} A_i = 0.9999856^{100} = 0.998561
\]
\[A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + 72} \]
\[MTTF \cdot A + 72 \cdot A = MTTF\]
\[MTTF \cdot A - MTTF = - 72 \cdot A\]
\[(A-1) \cdot MTTF = - 72 \cdot A\]
\[MTTF = \frac{72 \cdot A}{1 - A} = \frac{72 \cdot 0.998561}{1-0.998561} =
\frac{71,896392}{0,001439} =
49962.75 hours
\]

This is approximately 5.7 years.

If we consider a data center with 1000 server nodes, then:

\[A = 0,9999856^{1000} = 0.985703\]
\[MTTF = \frac{72 \cdot 0,985703}{0,014297} = 4964.02 hours\]

This is less than 7 months.

\end{enumerate}
