The increase in performance between 1986 and 2003 was around 52\% per year.
Between 2003 and 2011 it was 23\% per year. Between 2013 and 2015 it was
around 12\%. More recently, it has been 3.5\%.

Consider what would be the performance increase in 2025 with respect to
a processor from 2020.

\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

\[S_{52\%} = 1.52^5 = 8.11\]
\[S_{23\%} = 1.23^5 = 2.82\]
\[S_{12\%} = 1.12^5 = 1.76\]
\[S_{3.5\%} = 1.035^5 = 1.19\]
