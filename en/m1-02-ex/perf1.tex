Assume that Moore's Law was still in effect.
What would be the number of transistors in a chip in 2025 compared to year 2015?

\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

During Moore's Law the yearly increase in transistor count was between 40\% and 55\%.

\[1.4^{10} = 28.9\]
\[1.55^{10} = 80.4\]

The transistor count would be multiplied by a factor between 29 and 80.
