\section{Lab description}

This lab starts from a project provided to you that contains a main program
that runs an application with multiple threads.

You are provided a program \cppid{counter.cpp} with basic functionality.

\begin{itemize}

\item A class \cppid{counter} encapsulating a double precision floating point value, 
      initialized to zero.
      It has the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An \cppid{update()} function to increment the encapsulated value.
  \item A \cppid{print()} function to print the encapsulated value.
\end{itemize}

\item A main program launching multiple threads.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The number of threads is defined in constant \cppid{num\_threads}.
  \item The shared counter is local variable \cppid{count}.
  \item Each thread performs $100,000$ updates to the counter.
  \item When all threads have finished, the final result for the counter is printed.
  \item Additionally, the elapsed time for running all threads is printed.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

To carry out this lab, you must carry out all evaluations in the
\textemph{avignon} cluster.

You can download the initial code for this project from the following repository:
