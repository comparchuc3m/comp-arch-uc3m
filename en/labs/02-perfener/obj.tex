\section{Objective}

In this lab you will use three versions of the same program
that generate an image representing the Mandelbrot set.

The three version that you will use are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textmark{mandel.py}: 
        A version written in the Python programming language.
  \item \textmark{mandel.cpp}: 
        A basic version written in C++.
  \item \textmark{mandel-par.cpp}: 
        An optimized version written in C++.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, during this lab you will learn:


\begin{itemize}
  \item To launch jobs in the computing cluster from the Computer Science and Engineering lab.
  \item To get basic performance measurements when executing a program.
  \item To get the complete list of hardware counters.
  \item To carry out performance and energy measurements for an application.
\end{itemize}
