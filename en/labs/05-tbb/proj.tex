\subsection{Initial Project Structure}

The supplied code contains the general project structure with a
directory for each of the exercises we will perform.

The \textemph{CMakePresets.json} file contains the general project configuration
with the configuration and build \textmark{presets}.

To work with TBB you will need to have this
library installed. The library is already installed on all compute nodes of the
\textmark{avignon} system. It is also included in the
corresponding \textmark{Dockerfile} configuration in case you want to try the examples on your
machine. The package to install this library on a GNU/Linux machine
is \textemph{libtbb-dev}.

If you look at the \textemph{CMakeLists.txt} file the only relevant thing is in
the following line:

\begin{lstlisting}
find_package(TBB REQUIRED)
\end{lstlisting}

This tells CMake that it must find the TBB library installed on the system
and that otherwise it must generate a compilation error.

Within the project you will find a folder with the initial content of each
exercise. All code is always in a single file named
\cppid{main.cpp}. In the corresponding \textemph{CMakeLists.txt} file
you will find the executable definition and the dependency establishment
with respect to TBB.

\begin{lstlisting}
add_executable(invoke)
target_sources(invoke PRIVATE
    main.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(invoke PRIVATE
    TBB::tbb
)
\end{lstlisting}
