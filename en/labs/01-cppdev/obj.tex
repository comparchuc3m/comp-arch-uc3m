  \item Create a Docker image from a \textemph{Dockerfile}.

  \item Invoke the compiler from the command line.

  \item Build a project from the command line.

  \item Use the IDE \textmark{VS Code} to compile and run an application.

  \item Use the IDE \textmark{VS Code} to compile and run an application with several source files.

  \item Make small modifications to a simple CMake file.

  \item Compile debug (\textmark{Debug}) and optimized (\textmark{Release}) versions.

  \item Find memory leaks (\emph{memory leaks}) with dynamic analysis tools.

  \item Fix simple memory leak errors.

\end{itemize}
