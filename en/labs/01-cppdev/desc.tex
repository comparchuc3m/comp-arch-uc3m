\section{Lab description}

In this lab you will get used to the programming environment used in 
several parts of this course:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Operating Sytem: Linux
  \item C++ compiler: g++-10 or above (recommended g++-11 or g++-12).
  \item IDE: CLion.
  \item Build manager: CMake
  \item Dynamic anaysis tools: valgrind-memcheck and compiler \emph{sanitizers}.
\end{itemize}

To carry out this lab you have the following options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use your own laptop with Ubuntu/Linux as operating system
        or any other GNU/Linux distribution.

  \item Use your own laptop with MS Windows and WSL 2.
        Keep in mind that in that case you may get minor performance divergences.

  \item Use your own laptop with MacOS.
        Keep in mind that in that case you get minor performance divergences.

  \item You can also use a virtual machine with a GNU/Linux operating system
        for this lab, but be aware that this approach might be invalid for
        other labs in this course.
\end{itemize}
