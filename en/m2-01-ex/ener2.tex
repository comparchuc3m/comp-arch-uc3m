Frequency scaling and voltage scaling can be used to improve consumption at the
price of lower performance. Consider a mobile device with 4 general purpose
cores.  Assume that both dynamic power and dynamic energy are reduced to 10\%
of its value.  Given this situation, how much dynamic energy is required when
frequency scaling is applied? How much dynamic power is required?

\begin{acsolution}
\end{acsolution}

In this situation we have:
\[V_{new} = 0.1 \times V_{old}\]
\[f_{new} = 0.1 \times f_{old}\]

As, dynamic energy and power are
\[
E_d \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot X_c \cdot V^2
\]
\[
P_d \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot X_c \cdot V^2 \cdot f
\]

Consequently, the energy ratio is:
\[
\frac{E_{new}}{E_{old}} =
\frac{(0.1 \cdot \times V_{old})^2}{V_{old}^2} =
0.1^2 =
0.01
\] 

And the power ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_{new}}{P_{old}} =
\frac{(0.1 \cdot V_{old})^2 \cdot 0.1 \cdot f}{V_{old}^2 \cdot f} =
0.1^3 =
0.001
\]
